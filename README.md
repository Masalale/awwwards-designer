## What This Skill Does

Transforms AI agents into elite design architects capable of producing award-winning websites. Unlike template-based approaches, every project invents its own visual language.

### Key Features

- **🎯 Design-First Process** — Code only after design approval
- **📐 Mathematical Intentionality** — Golden Ratio (Φ) based spacing, typography, and proportions
- **🎨 Bespoke Creation** — No categories, no templates — unique visual languages every time
- **🌊 Animation-First** — GSAP, Framer Motion, Three.js integration patterns
- **🛠️ Framework-Aware** — Next.js, Astro, TanStack Start, Remix guidance
- **✨ Anti-AI-Slop** — Explicit constraints against generic design patterns

## Installation

```bash
# Clone to your OpenClaw skills directory
git clone https://github.com/masalale/hadnoir-dna.git ~/.openclaw/skills/hadnoir_dna_v4

# Or use clawhub (when published)
clawhub install hadnoir-dna
```

## Usage

The skill auto-activates when you mention:
- "build a website"
- "create a landing page"
- "design a portfolio"
- "premium brand site"
- "immersive experience"
- "award-winning design"
- "luxury website"
- "fashion brand website"
- "3D website"
- "WebGL experience"

### The 4-Phase Process

1. **Discovery** — Explore context, ask clarifying questions
2. **Design Direction** — Present 2-3 bespoke approaches (no templates!)
3. **Approval & Documentation** — Design doc at `docs/designs/`
4. **Implementation** — Code with constraint enforcement

**Total: ~78KB of design intelligence**

## Design Philosophy

### The Hadnoir Principles

1. **Mathematical Intentionality** — Every value is purposeful
2. **Bespoke Creation** — Never reuse aesthetic categories
3. **Motion as Meaning** — Animations communicate purpose
4. **Framework Agnosticism** — Design transcends implementation

### Forbidden Patterns (Auto-Reject)

The skill explicitly prevents:
- Inter/Roboto as display fonts
- 3-column feature grids
- Purple gradient on white ("AI slop")
- `transition: all`
- Linear easing
- Images without dimensions

## Example Output

When you say: *"Build me a luxury fashion website"*

The skill will:
1. Ask about brand personality, audience, inspiration
2. Present approaches like:
   - *"Japanese wabi-sabi imperfection meets Swiss grid precision"*
   - *"90s rave flyer energy reimagined through luxury editorial lens"*
3. Create design doc with Φ-based spacing, custom easing curves
4. Implement with Tailwind + GSAP + accessibility

## Quality Benchmarks

Work produced should feel capable of winning:
- **Awwwards Site of the Day**
- **FWA Award**
- **CSS Design Award**
