## What This Skill Does

Transforms AI agents into elite design architects capable of producing award-winning websites autonomously and efficiently. It prioritizes executing high-quality code over bureaucratic planning.

### Key Features
- **🎯 Execution-First** — Biased towards rapid, high-quality output.
- **📐 Mathematical Intentionality** — Golden Ratio (Φ) based proportions.
- **🎨 Bespoke Creation** — Unique visual languages preventing generic "AI slop."
- **🌊 Animation-First** — GSAP, Framer Motion, and Three.js recipes.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masalale/awwwards-designer.git ~/.openclaw/skills/awwwards-designer
```

## Usage

When activated by your AI agent, use natural language triggers like:
- *"Build a portfolio website."*
- *"Create an Awwwards-caliber landing page."*
- *"Design an immersive 3D experience."*

The agent will automatically determine the best approach (defaulting to Astro) and execute immediately, pulling predefined parametric design constraints, layouts, and high-end animation recipes to deliver production-ready code.
